# Casus Belli Game Client

_Casus Belli_ ("justification for war") is a game of strategy, diplomacy and battle. It was
originally created as a gift by the father of [hermannm](https://github.com/hermannm), a developer
of this project. This digital edition of the board game consists of a server written in Go, and a
client built with the Unity game engine and C#.
